context.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles("dev");

only profile name change.so no-need to change huge amount of code.

context.getEnvironment().setActiveProfiles("tester");

note:-whenever we give our application to tester environment then 
      tester environment are different. so tester environment 
      datasource are diffrent so when modify the code then problem
      is occured thatwhy for resolve this problem @Profile comes into 
      picture.
      	so we no-need to change huge code.We change only "dev" profile
      	to "tester" profile name in Test.java class.
